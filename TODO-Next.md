# Next

Follow-up work after the v1 rename. Independent of that branch, which is already
large.

## 1. Publishing Stays Release-Driven

Decided: keep publishing on tag push and manual dispatch until 1.0 is
formalized. No change to `publish.yml`. The container image keeps publishing
from `main` on its own cadence, which is fine because date tags are always
unique.

Revisit at 1.0, and note two things that will matter then:

- **nuget.org and GitHub Packages both reject a version that already exists,
  permanently.** Any "publish on push" scheme has to publish only when
  `ModuleVersion` changes, or it fails on the second push.
- **The first nuget.org push claims `SubZeroDev.PSGenerator` forever.** It can be
  deprecated but never renamed, so confirm the public name before publishing.

Also worth deciding then: whether the image should carry `:1.0.0` alongside
`:latest` and the date tag, so an image can be matched to a package version.

## 2. Gaps Found During the Rename

Small, concrete, and each one is a thing that can silently rot.

The first three gaps are designed and sequenced in
[`planning/quality-safeguards-implementation-plan.md`](planning/quality-safeguards-implementation-plan.md).

- **No status check is required on `main`.** The `Main` ruleset now protects the
  branch — a pull request is required, force pushes and deletion are blocked,
  admins are included, review threads must be resolved, and merges are squash or
  rebase only. What it does not have is a `required_status_checks` rule, and
  neither does classic protection, so a red PowerShell quality, documentation,
  Pester, or docs run still does not block a merge. The deploy-path coverage
  added in #61 exists specifically to fail before merge rather than after;
  without required checks it only reports.

  Add these ten contexts, exactly as CI reports them. A misspelled or unavailable
  required context remains expected or pending and blocks merging indefinitely,
  so exact names matter:

  ```text
  Build and publish image
  Container end-to-end
  Documentation links and terminology
  Pester (ubuntu-latest)
  Pester (windows-latest)
  PowerShell 7.4 baseline (ubuntu-latest)
  PowerShell 7.4 baseline (windows-latest)
  PowerShell NuGet package
  PowerShell quality
  Verify documentation / Verify Documentation Build
  ```

  Only the reusable documentation workflow carries a `caller / job` prefix; the
  rest report their job name alone.

  Do not require `Deploy documentation`: it is skipped on pull requests by
  design, because its job is gated on `github.event_name == 'push'`.
- **Automatic branch deletion is enabled.** Nine stale branches accumulated before
  being cleaned up, all of them pointers into already-merged history.
  `delete_branch_on_merge = true` is now confirmed through the repository API.
  Preserve that owner-controlled setting while adding required checks, and verify
  it with the same temporary merge used to validate the ruleset.
- **A generated command can shadow an existing one.** Since the inference naming
  fix, `convertto-json.ps1` produces `ConvertTo-Json`, which shadows the built-in
  once the module is imported. Documented as a note in the script inference
  guide, but inference could detect the collision and warn, the same way it warns
  about source commands without runtime mappings.
- **`.gitignore` does not cover `bin/` and `obj/`.** The BuildAgent fixture's
  `.csproj` files produce build output that shows up as untracked noise whenever
  anything builds them. Those directories are currently empty, so it is quiet
  right now, and it will come back.

## 3. Still Open on the v1 Roadmap

Not re-planned here, just so it is not forgotten. `TODO.md` still has:

- **§3 Docker-BuildAgent compatibility** — 11 of 13 items unchecked, and this is
  the largest remaining piece of engineering. Includes the maintenance-script
  classification that would keep repo tooling out of a public command surface.
- **§4 Inspector hardening** — all 6 unchecked, starting with the warn-versus-fail
  malformed-input policy.
- **§5** — device and GPU mappings on runners that expose the hardware.
- **Three documentation-toolchain follow-ups** — the `docs-build.ps1` prune
  manifest, whether `docs/Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` should stay, and
  whether the `docs.yml` caller is still worth having. All upstream-shaped and
  lower priority since the 404 fix removed the reason the prune manifest existed.

## Sequencing

Dropping Docusaurus versioning is done, so the snapshot no longer has to be
re-cut on every documentation change.

Of what remains, required status checks are the highest leverage: without them,
none of the gates block a merge. Automatic branch deletion is already enabled.
After that, the `index.md` drift check, since it closes a gap that currently
depends on someone remembering. Publishing waits for 1.0.
